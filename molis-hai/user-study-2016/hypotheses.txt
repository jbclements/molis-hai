Hypotheses, recorded before testing:

- students given the experimental passwords will "learn" their passwords
  after less elapsed time.  Specifically, students are considered to have "learned"
  a password when on three consecutive trials spaced by at least 23
  hours, they enter the password correctly into the box on the first attempt.

- students given the experimental passwords will "learn" their passwords
  after fewer trials.  Specifically, students are considered to have "learned"
  a password when on three consecutive trials spaced by at least 23
  hours, they enter the password correctly into the box on the first attempt.

- students given the experimental passwords will exhibit fewer errors
  (measured using the levenshtein distance divided by the string length)
  during the learning process.

- students given the experimental passwords will retain their passwords
  better after an extended break of 1 week.

hypotheses unrelated to molis hai:

- students will learn the beginnings of their passwords first.

- students with 3 successes will no longer make mistakes.

- box 5 will always be better than box 1

- box 5 will always be as good or better than the following box 1

- students will make the same mistakes--that is, once a portion is learned, it will tend to stay learned.
