;; this code is for extracting sent emails. More specifically,
;; it extracts only non-quoted text from an mboxcl2-formatted
;; file (that is, the standard UNIX 'mbox' format.) If you
;; want to run this code, you'll have to install the mboxrd
;; package.

;; message -> (listof string)
;; given a message, use net/mime to extract a viable "text part", and
;; then return only that text which is not quoted--that is, which appears
;; to have been written by me.
